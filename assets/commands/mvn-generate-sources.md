> Pass a system property to the build.

# DESCRIPTION

**mvn generate-sources** invokes Maven's **generate-sources** lifecycle phase, which (along with all earlier phases — **validate**, **initialize**) runs any plugin executions bound to it. This is where code generators belong: JAXB / XJC, gRPC / Protocol Buffers, Avro, Antlr, OpenAPI, Modello, JOOQ, etc. Generated sources usually land under **target/generated-sources/**_plugin_/ and are added to the compile source roots automatically when the next phase, **process-sources** → **compile**, runs.

Because Maven runs every preceding phase as well, **mvn generate-sources** is rarely the most useful command on its own — most users invoke **mvn compile** or **mvn package** and let generation happen as a side effect. Use this phase explicitly when you want generated code available for IDE refresh without compiling the whole project.

# CAVEATS

Generated sources are wiped by **mvn clean**. Plugins must be bound to **generate-sources** in **pom.xml** or activated by a profile; otherwise nothing happens. Multiple plugins generating into the same root can collide.
